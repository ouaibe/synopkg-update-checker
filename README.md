# synopkg-update-checker

Check Synology DSM or BSM system updates and installed package updates from the Synology archive and supported community sources.

Language: 🇬🇧 English | [🇩🇪 Deutsch](README.de.md)

## Overview

This script currently supports:

- DSM or BSM operating system update checks via the Synology archive
- package update checks for:
  - official Synology packages
  - SynoCommunity packages
  - GitHub releases when a package distributor points to GitHub
- compatibility-aware package evaluation based on SPK metadata (`os_min_ver` / `firmware`)
- interactive installation with on-demand package downloads after confirmation
- optional HTML email reporting with clickable links and source badges
- filters for running packages, official packages, community packages, OS-only, or packages-only checks

## Requirements

- Synology NAS running DSM or BSM
- required commands:
  - `curl`
  - `dmidecode`
  - `getopt`
  - `jq`
  - `synogetkeyvalue`
  - `synopkg`
  - `wget`
- for email mode: `ssmtp`, `sendmail`, or `synodsmnotify`
- DSM email notification settings configured when using email reports
- root or sudo privileges recommended, and required for package installation

## Usage

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh [options]
```

```text
Options:
  -i, --info          Display system and update information only
  --info-fail-on-updates Exit 1 when selected checks find updates, otherwise exit 0
                      (works only with --info)
  -e, --email         Send the report by email and automatically enable info mode
  --email-updates-only Send a report only when at least one update is available
                      (works only with --email)
  --email-to <email>  Override the configured DSM recipient address
  -r, --running       Check updates only for currently running packages
  --official-only     Show only official Synology packages
  --community-only    Show only community or third-party packages
  --os-only           Check only for operating system updates
  --packages-only     Check only for package updates
  -n, --dry-run       Simulate actions without downloading or installing
  -v, --verbose       Reserved flag, currently not implemented
  -d, --debug         Enable detailed debug output
  -h, --help          Show help
```

## Option details

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-i`, `--info` | Prints a report only. No downloads and no installation menu. |
| `--info-fail-on-updates` | Only valid together with `--info`. Makes the script exit with status `1` when at least one OS or package update is found for the selected checks, and `0` otherwise. Designed for **Synology Task Scheduler**: create a scheduled task running `synopkg-update-checker.sh --info --info-fail-on-updates`, enable *"Send run details only when the script terminates abnormally"*, and you can run it daily but only get an email on the days an update is actually available. Also handy for any cron job or monitoring that keys off the exit code. |
| `-e`, `--email` | Sends the report as HTML email and automatically switches to info mode. No normal stdout report is produced. |
| `--email-updates-only` | In combination with `--email`, sends a report only if at least one OS or package update is available. |
| `--email-to <email>` | Uses a custom recipient instead of the DSM notification configuration. |
| `-r`, `--running` | Limits package checks to services that are currently running. |
| `--official-only` | Shows only official Synology packages. |
| `--community-only` | Shows only community or third-party packages. Cannot be combined with `--official-only`. |
| `--os-only` | Skips package checks and only reports DSM or BSM updates. |
| `--packages-only` | Skips OS checks and only reports package updates. Cannot be combined with `--os-only`. |
| `-n`, `--dry-run` | Simulates the run without downloading or installing any package. |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Shows additional internal details and, in email mode, stores a local HTML copy in `debug/`. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Present in the CLI, but not used by the current code yet. |

## Update sources and detection

The script identifies package sources from the package INFO metadata in `/var/packages/<package>/INFO`.

- **Official Synology package**
  - no `distributor` field, or
  - `distributor="Synology Inc."`
- **GitHub package**
  - the distributor contains a GitHub URL such as `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`
  - the script checks the latest GitHub release and looks for matching `.spk` assets
- **Community package**
  - any other non-Synology distributor
  - SynoCommunity pages are checked directly when applicable

For package downloads, the script now uses the package-specific `arch` value from each package INFO file, plus the system platform name, to find the best matching SPK file.

For compatible update decisions, the script also inspects SPK metadata (`os_min_ver`, fallback `firmware`) and compares it with the currently installed DSM or BSM version.

## Package table semantics

The package section reports both actionable and non-actionable version states:

- **Installed**: currently installed package version
- **Latest Compatible**: newest package version compatible with the current OS
- **Latest Available**: newest package version found upstream for the package source
- **Min OS Req**: minimum OS required by the **Latest Available** package (if provided by SPK metadata)
- **Update**:
  - `X` when `Latest Compatible` is newer than `Installed`
  - `-` when no compatible update is currently installable

This makes it clear when a newer upstream package exists but requires a newer DSM or BSM version.

Example:

```text
Package      | Installed   | Latest Compatible | Latest Available | Min OS Req   | Update
FileStation  | 1.4.3-1610  | 1.4.3-1610        | 1.5.1-2410       | 7.4-101141   | -
```

Interpretation: a newer upstream version exists, but it is not installable on the current DSM/BSM version yet.

## Email report formatting

When email mode is used, the report contains styled HTML tables and visual badges:

- 🏢 **OFFICIAL** for Synology packages
- 👥 **COMMUNITY** for community repositories
- 🐙 **GITHUB** for packages tracked from GitHub releases
- 🔴 means an update is available
- 🟢 means the installed item is already up to date

The terminal table still uses simple values in the **Update** column:

- `X` = update available
- `-` = no update

## Workflow

1. Collect system information:
   - product
   - model
   - architecture
   - platform name
   - operating system
   - installed version

2. Check operating system updates:
   - query the Synology archive
   - compare installed and available versions
   - verify model or platform compatibility
   - show a direct `.pat` download link when an update exists

3. Check installed packages:
   - list installed packages in stable alphabetical order
   - detect each package source
   - apply active filters such as running-only or official-only
  - determine latest available and latest compatible versions
  - validate candidate SPKs against current OS requirements (`os_min_ver` / `firmware`)
   - collect matching download URLs for updateable packages

4. In normal mode:
  - collect and display download links for updateable packages
  - present an interactive selection menu
  - after confirmation, download only the selected package(s) and install them

5. Cleanup:
   - remove the temporary download directory when the run is finished

## Important notes and limitations

- OS updates are **reported with download links only**. The current script does not install DSM or BSM updates automatically.
- Package installation requires confirmation and should be run with appropriate privileges.
- `--email` depends on DSM mail settings or an explicit `--email-to` override.
- In `--debug --email` mode, a copy of the generated HTML report is saved as `debug/email_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html`.
- If sending the email fails, the script exits with an error.

## Examples

### Show a report only

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh --info
```

### Send the report by email

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh --email
```

### Send the report to a custom recipient

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh --email --email-to you@example.com
```

### Check only running official packages

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh --info --running --official-only
```

### Check only community and GitHub-based packages

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh --info --community-only --packages-only
```

### Simulate the installation flow

```bash
./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh --dry-run
```

### Select and install available package updates (download on demand)

```bash
sudo ./bin/synopkg-update-checker.sh
```

## Output directories

## DSM email configuration

If you want to use email reporting, configure DSM notifications first:
